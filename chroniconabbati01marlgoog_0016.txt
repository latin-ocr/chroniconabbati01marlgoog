' ξ 3. Of the three books into which the Chronicle is
divided, the ¹first two, which contaiu the Life and
Miracles of S. ngin (excepting the Legend for the
festival of the Translati'on)‚ written in the ordinary
verbose and grandiloquent style of hagiographers‚ are
assigned in the rubrius at their head to prior Dominio.
These, that writer tells us (p. 2.), he wrote at the
request of his brethren3 but almost the next generation
that followed appears to have grown sufficiently weary
of the worthy prior’s prolixity to request Marleberge
to curtail it to more readable proportione (pp. 27—-8).
Professedly “abridged,'’ as Dominic's work now is, by
the handoi the latter, there is sufficient evidence still
leit to show that, *in the glories of his subject, the
author had indeed lost all thought of the “fastidiosi
“ auditores '³ whose better taste Marleberge sought to
consult. ¹ '

§k There can be no doubt that the history of
the Translation and Miracles of S. Odulph and the
anecdotes of several members of the abbcy, which are
printed in the Appendix to the present volume, are
als'o the work of Dominio. The sounding declamatory
verbiage in which he delights, and which forms such
a marked contrast to the ruore matter-of-faot style of
his successor, would of itselt almost unmistakeably
assent his claim3 but at p. 320 we are expressly told
that the writer of the Miracles oi Odulph was the
same as the biographer of ngin. We learn also, from
the same passage, that Dominio was the author of a
third tract of a sinular character, vin, an account of
Miracles wrought by the Blessed Virgin, which com-
menced with the words “AEterna Dei sapientia.'’
Possibly, also, the Liie of S. Wisian, although in its
present shape it is the work of Marleberge, may (as
its style would in some degree suggest) have been
founded on some previous memoir by Dominio, which
Marleberge may have used and enlarged (see p. 27),
