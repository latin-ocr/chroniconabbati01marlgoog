ΟΝ the nothos J anuary 1857, = theMaster 01 the Rolls

Ἴ submitted to the Treasury a proposal 'for the publication ‘¹

01 materials for the History of this Country from the
3 Invasion 01 the Romans to the Reigu 01 Henry VIII.

The Master 01 the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication undercompetent editors
without reference to periodical ,or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgmeot, preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materiale as ,were most

’ scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document

π 10 be edited should be treated in the same way as if the

editor were engaged on anEditio Princeps3 and for this

purpose the rnost correct text should be formed from an Ἴ ,Ν

accurate collation 01 the best MSS. =

To render the work more generally useful, the Master = '

of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, 01 their age and
their peculiarities 3 that he should add to the work a brief
account of the life and times 01 the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no other·
note or comment was to be allowed, except what might. he

necessary to establish tbe correctness 01 the text.
