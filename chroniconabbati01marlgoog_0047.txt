(p. 273). It is very evident that the loss of some of
the Worcester lands to Evesham, in whatever way it
happened, made Heming guilty of great injustice in
his character of Agelwy. The matter-of-fact account
given in our text of the good deeds of the' latter is
too plain and straightforward to be rendered unworthy*

was connected with that described in our text as
ending in the loss of twenty-eight villages‚ including
Hampton and Bengeworth, and which is said to have
